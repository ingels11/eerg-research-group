Having studied weight management and obesity at UGA throughout graduate school, my primary research interest is in health policy, and specifically evaluating and quantifying the policiesâ€™ impact on nutrition choices among individuals throughout the larger Georgia community. I specialize in quantitative and qualitative data analysis, and am currently using my analytic skills to evaluate emergency operations and response at the CDC in Atlanta!
