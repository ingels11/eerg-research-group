Jessica graduated in May of 2021 with my Master of Public Health with a concentration in Policy and Management from UGA. She is thankful to have had the opportunity to work with Dr. Thapa and focus on issues related to adolescent wellbeing. Within the public health field, she is interested in behavioral health. Since graduation, she has started working for Charlie Health. Charlie Health is a virtual mental health provider that focuses on rural adolescents. It is the first high acuity mental telehealth provider, and she is excited to be part of their committed and innovative organization. She is excited to learn more while working within the industry, however, she valued her time participating in research with Dr. Thapa and will consider pursuing a Ph.D. in Public Health in the future.
