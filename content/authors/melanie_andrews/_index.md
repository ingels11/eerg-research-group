Having studied weight management and obesity at UGA throughout graduate school, my primary research interest is in health policy, and specifically evaluating and quantifying the policies’ impact on nutrition choices among individuals throughout the larger Georgia community. I specialize in quantitative and qualitative data analysis, and am currently using my analytic skills to evaluate emergency operations and response at the CDC in Atlanta!
