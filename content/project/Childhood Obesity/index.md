Obesity has risen in the United States over the past four decades. Childhood Obesity is associated with numerous poor health outcomes, loss of productivity, and increased healthcare costs. Current policy interventions fail to account for locally built environments such as access to food, number of fast-food vs healthy food outlets, and other environmental factors. Current measurements of the environment fail to consider school level factors. Built environment research typically is organized by geographic unit but does not account for school level differences. We propose to improve the current methodology by using the school attendance zone as part of the analysis scale. These findings will inform Georgia Legislators on future evidence-based policy evaluation research.
