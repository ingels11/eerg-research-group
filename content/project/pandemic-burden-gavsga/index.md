The maps show COVID-19 confirmed case and death rates in Georgia counties relative to the state of Georgia. The case and death rates are adjusted to reflect rates per 10,000 population. The maps also showcase the fatality rate, which is the number of deaths per 100 confirmed cases.

These maps are based on data as of 28 April 2020. The pandemic is evolving, and we will update the maps every week.
