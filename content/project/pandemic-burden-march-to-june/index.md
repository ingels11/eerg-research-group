{{< figure src="March_to_June.jpg" lightbox="true" >}}

The maps shows the following for the months of March, April, May, and June:  

1.	Georgia counties’ socio-demographic and health vulnerability based on indices generated utilizing secondary data from the American Census Survey and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The index measures vulnerability based on the following items: percentage of the population over 65, percentage of the minority population, percentage population below poverty, percentage population with diabetes, percentage population with obesity, CVD mortality among 65 and over as percentage of population, and percentage population that were hospitalized for CVD. The higher the index number the higher is the counties’ socio-demographic and health vulnerability.
2.	Number of COVID-19 cases 
3.	Incidence per 10,000 population

Takeaways:

**Counties and the number of COVID-19 cases by month**

**Counties and COVID-19 case cumulative incidence (cases per 10,000 population) by month**

{{< figure src="table2.png" lightbox="true" >}}

There are two counties with a cumulative incidence in the 301 to 500 per 10,000 population, they are Chattahoochee, Echols.
We will continue tracking the pandemic on a monthly basis.
