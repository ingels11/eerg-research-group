EERG member Justin Ingels assisted HPAM faculty member Grace Bagwell-Adams with two major efforts aimed at informing local leaders on the potential impacts of COVID-19. 

First, utilizing data from the <a href="http://www.athenswellbeingproject.org/" target="_blank">Athens Wellbeing Project</a> and other information related to hospital supply, a presentation was developed and presented to a special session of the Athens-Clarke County Mayor and Commission on March 19, 2020. Video of the presentation is available here:

Second, utilizing an infectious disease model developed by UGA colleagues, a report for the local hospital system was developed and can be found <a  href="http://publichealth.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19_-ACC-Health-Service-Area-Modeling-Report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
