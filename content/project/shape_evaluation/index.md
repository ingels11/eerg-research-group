## Evaluation of a Statewide Policy Mandating School-based Fitness Assessment 

In an effort to combat escalating obesity rates, many states have adopted school-based policies that will encourage increased physical activity and improved nutrition. Enacted legislation targeting children in schools have ranged from general health promotion, to increased reporting of fitness levels, to specific school time allotments for physical activity. In Georgia, full implementation of a policy to combat the rising epidemic of childhood obesity in the state began in the 2014-2015 academic year. In the first phase of Georgia’s childhood obesity prevention policy, the Georgia Student Health and Physical Education (SHAPE) Act was passed by the Georgia legislature to combat the rising epidemic of childhood obesity in the state. Beginning in the 2011-2012 school year, the law required each local school district to conduct an annual fitness assessment program for all students enrolled in classes taught by certified physical education teachers. The FitnessGram®, which is a standardized tool used to assess five facets of health-related fitness including aerobic capacity, muscular strength, endurance, flexibility, and body composition, was chosen as the tool to assess physical fitness state-wide. In the second phase of Georgia’s childhood obesity prevention policy, the Departments of Public Health and Education are promoting 30 minutes of physical activity (in addition to regular physical education) for every child each school day. Beginning in the 2014-2015 academic year, in-person training on approaches for incorporating physical activity into the school day is being provided to key school personnel.

More information about this policy can be found <a href="http://www.georgiashape.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.

### EERG Evaluation

The goal of our evaluation has been to assess population awareness of the SHAPE policy, the school implementation and costs of the SHAPE policy, and assess what variables impact school implementation of the SHAPE policy and how that implementation impacts school-level obesity and fitness levels.

### Publications

Our first publication has focused on the variables that impact school implementation of the SHAPE policy, find out more [here]({{< ref "/publication/thapa-2020-longitudinal/index.md" >}}).
