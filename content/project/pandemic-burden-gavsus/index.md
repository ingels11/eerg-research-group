The maps show COVID-19 confirmed case and death rates in Georgia counties relative to the US. The case and death rates are adjusted to reflect rates per 10,000 population. The maps also showcase the fatality rate, which is the number of deaths per 100 confirmed cases in Georgia, relative to the US.

Takeaways:

* Population adjusted COVID-19 cases, deaths, and fatality rates in Georgia (state average) are lower than in the US.  
* Thirty-seven counties exceeded the national average on COVID-19 case count, 32 counties exceeded the national average on COVID-19 deaths and case fatality rates. For the list of counties, please follow the county list {{% staticref "files/county_list_round1_map.pdf" "newtab" %}}here{{% /staticref %}}. 
* These maps are based on data as of 28 April 2020. The pandemic is evolving, and we will update the maps every week.
