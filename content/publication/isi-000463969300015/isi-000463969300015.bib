 abstract = {Telestroke is a telemedicine intervention that facilitates communication
between stroke centers and lower-resourced facilities to optimize acute
stroke management. Using administrative claims data, we assessed trends
in telestroke use among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with
acute ischemic stroke and the association between providing telestroke
services and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) and
mechanical thrombectomy use, mortality, and medical expenditures, by
urban versus rural county of residence in the period 2008-15. The
proportion of ischemic stroke cases receiving telestroke increased from
0.4 to 3.8 per 1,000 cases, with usage highest among younger, male,
non-Hispanic white, and patients in rural or super rural areas (super
rural is the bottom quartile of rural areas. Compared with patients
receiving usual care, those receiving telestroke had greater IV tPA and
mechanical thrombectomy use regardless of county type, while those in
super rural counties had lower thirty-day all-cause mortality. Despite
increased telestroke use, rural patients remained less likely than urban
patients to receive N tPA. The findings suggest that telestroke service
expansion efforts have increased, especially in rural and super rural
counties, and have improved outcomes.},
