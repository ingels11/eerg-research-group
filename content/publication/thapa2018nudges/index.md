abstract: "**Purpose/Objectives**
Research on incentivizing consumption of fruits and vegetables (F/V) has been and continues to
be conducted in school lunchrooms. This study examined the use of stickers and toys to nudge
F/V selection and consumption among students in grades 1 through 5. The study was conducted
in two low-income elementary schools in West Texas.
**Methods**
Kid friendly stickers were applied to the schoolsâ€™ lunchroom F/V serving containers in a food
safe manner. Students who selected and consumed their F/V portion were given an inexpensive
toy at the end of the lunch period. Consumption and selection of F/V was measured over three
periods starting with the observation at baseline period (13 days) followed by the intervention
period (15 days) and the post-intervention period (14 days).
**Results**
Results suggest that displaying stickers to change the choice architecture while using incentive to
promote consumption in school lunchrooms, sustainably and inexpensively increased the
selection and consumption of F/V in these settings at one cent per serving. The number of
servings of F/V consumed increased from 1.77 during baseline to 6.08 during intervention (p
value <.0001, 242% higher than at baseline). A smaller but significant improvement was
sustained post intervention where servings of F/V consumed was 2.51 (p value <.0001, 42%
higher than at baseline).
**Conclusions and Application**
The findings of this study support a low-cost method to improve F/V consumption that can easily
be replicated across the country. Similar low-cost interventions can support current policy
emphasis in improving F/V consumption and combating childhood obesity."
