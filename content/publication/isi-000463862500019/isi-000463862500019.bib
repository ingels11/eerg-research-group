 abstract = {Background: Obesity has become a global epidemic, with substantial
impacts on children's health. Numerous intervention studies for the
prevention of obesity in children have been conducted during the most
recent decade, but very few have evaluated the long-term and sustainable
effectiveness of such prevention efforts.
Methods: We conducted a follow-up study during September 2015 and
September 2017, based upon a previous 3-year cluster
randomized-controlled study (RCT) for a comprehensive childhood-obesity
intervention in 14 primary schools in Shanghai, China. A total of 929
students were enrolled in the study. Generalized estimating equation
approaches were applied to analyse student's body mass index (BMI), BMI
z-score at baseline and three annual long-term follow-ups.
Results: Three years after the end of the RCT study, the odds of
developing obesity and the odds of developing obesity or overweight in
the intervention group were both lower than in the control group among
girls [OR(obesity)= 0.299, p= 0.010 and OR (overweight/obesity) 0.493,
p 0.013]; the odds of developing obesity or overweight in the
intervention group was lower than in the control group among boys (OR =
0.369, p= 0.017). Compared with the baseline, the BMI z-scores in the
intervention group were lower than those in the control group for both
normal-weight students (-0.027) and overweight or obese students
(-0.074).
Conclusions: The 3-year RCT showed significant and reliable long-term
effects on preventing childhood obesity, particularly among girls.},
