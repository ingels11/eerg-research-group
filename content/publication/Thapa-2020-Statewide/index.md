abstract: "Objectives. To evaluate the statewide implementation of childhood fitness assessment and reporting in Georgia.

Methods. We collected survey data from 1683 (919 valid responses from a random-digit-dialed survey and 764 valid responses from a Qualtrics panel) parents of public school students in Georgia in 2018.

Results. Most parents reported that their child participated in fitness assessments at school, yet only 31% reported receiving results. If a child was identified as needing improvement, parents were significantly more likely to change the diet and exercise of both the child and the family.

Conclusions. A state-level mandatory fitness assessment for children may be successful in state-level surveillance of fitness levels; parental awareness of the policy, receipt of the fitness assessment information, and action on receiving the screening information require more efforts in implementation."
