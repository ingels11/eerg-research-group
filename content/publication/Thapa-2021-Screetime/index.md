abstract: "High levels of sedentary activity and low levels of physical activity have led to an increase in childhood obesity. A
reduction of sedentary behavior and the promotion of an active lifestyle positively impacts weight status of children. A child may
modify their behavior through direct interventions from their parents, such as enforcement of rules or guided activities, or through
broad interventions, by expressing their values and modeling behavior. Current research does not establish if broad or specific
parental involvement has a greater effect on healthy behavior. Our group sought to support existing evidence that parental
involvement directly impacts behavior that reduces the likelihood of childhood obesity and determines if broad or specific
parental involvement had a greater impact on healthy behavior"
