abstract: "PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES
Fruit and vegetable (F/V) consumption among children continues to be lower than
recommended. This study tested the effectiveness of nudges using fun facts about F/V on F/V
consumption by elementary school students in grades 1 through 5. The study hypothesis is higher
F/V consumption with nudges.
METHODS
The design was a randomized comparison of F/V consumption with use of nudges to that without
the nudges. Unlike previous studies, the intervention effectiveness was tested in two adjacent
school districts in Georgia that differed in terms of socio-economic status (SES) of the students
served. Four schools were selected from each school district to participate in the study. Two
schools in each district were assigned to the control arm and two to the intervention arm. Fun
facts about a select list of F/V were developed and communicated to intervention arm students
using table tents. F/V selection and consumption were observed in both arms.
RESULTS
A total of 7,112 trays was observed across all eight schools. Consumption of F/V after nudges
increased by 0.14 servings (p <0.001) in the two intervention schools of the district with higher
SES. The intervention impact was significant when fewer F/V choices were offered in
participating school lunchrooms. Increase in consumption of F/V after nudges was not
significant in the district with low SES.
APPLICATION TO CHILD NUTRITION PROFESSIONALS
Our study concludes that using fun facts about F/V can increase their consumption, yet impact is
not consistent among schools districts that serve students in different SES. Findings in this study
showed students in districts with higher SES reacted positively to fun fact nudges with increased
consumption of F/V."
