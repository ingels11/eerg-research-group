abstract: "OBJECTIVE: This study examines insurance coverage rates among working-age adults with low income and with or without obesity before and after Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. METHODS: Individual-level data on noninstitutionalized and nonpregnant adult participants aged 18 to 64 years with household income below $15,000 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2006-2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were used. A difference-in-differences design with logistic regression was used to examine the likelihood of insurance coverage before and after Medicaid expansion. RESULTS: Working-age adults (analytic sample N = 316,151) who were white, female, less educated, unemployed, and living in a Medicaid-expansion state were more likely to have insurance coverage. The insurance coverage rate in Medicaid-expanded states in years after expansion increased for both subgroups with and without obesity. However, the increase was slightly lower for the subpopulation with obesity (5.59%, 95% CI: 2.35%-8.83%) compared with the subpopulation without obesity (7.35%, 95% CI: 5.35%-9.34%). CONCLUSIONS: Increased attention should be paid to reduce insurance coverage barriers for working-age adults with low income and obesity to address potential health disparities caused by lack of access to care. This is important, as access to care provides opportunities to increase prevention and treatment-oriented services to address obesity and associated health care costs."
