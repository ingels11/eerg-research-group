 abstract = {Obesity is a risk for certain types of cancer; however, awareness of
obesity as a risk factor for cancer is low. This study evaluated
increases in cancer risk awareness, including obesity as a risk factor
for cancer, from a quasi-experimental intervention that provided
educational materials and community reinforcement for healthy living.
The study uses data on participant's awareness of cancer risk factors
along with sociodemographic variables collected from in-person surveys
(N = 863) at baseline (June 2011) and post intervention (June 2012). The
average awareness that overweight and obesity are risk factors for
cancer was low (35 %) compared to chewing tobacco (92 %), using
tanning bed (73 %), and sunburn (97 %) at baseline. The intervention
significantly increased participants' awareness that overweight and
obesity are risk factors for cancer. Based on regression analysis, the
unadjusted intervention effect on cancer risk awareness was significant:
0.392 +/- 0.165 (p value = 0.020) for matched participants and 0.282 +/-
0.125 (p value = 0.024) for community participants. The adjusted
intervention effect was significant in the matched participants (0.528
+/- 0.189, p value = 0.006). Education, income, gender, and age had a
significant impact on cancer risk awareness for the community
participants. The results show that community intervention that
incorporates community reinforcement can have the desired effect
regardless of differences at participant level. Such interventions could
be used to prevent cancer risk in communities that are at high risk.},
