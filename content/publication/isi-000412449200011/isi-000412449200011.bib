 abstract = {PurposeThis study aimed to assess the relationship between rural or
urban residence and having a usual source of care (USC), and the
utilization of preventive dental checkups among adults.
MethodsCross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 2012. We performed a logit regression
on the relationship between rural and urban residence, having a USC, and
having at least 1 dental checkup in the past year, adjusting for
sociodemographic characteristics and health status.
FindingsAfter controlling for covariates, rural adult residents had
significantly lower odds of having at least 1 dental checkup per year
compared to their urban counterparts (odds ratio [OR] = 0.73, 95%
confidence interval [CI]: 0.62-0.86, P < .001). Additionally,
individuals with a USC had higher odds of having at least 1 dental
checkup per year (OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.59-1.95, P < .001). Among both
rural and urban residents, having a USC was significantly associated
with an 11% (95% CI = 9%-13%) increase in the probability of having
a preventive dental checkup within a year.
ConclusionsIndividuals with a USC were more likely to obtain a
preventive dental visit, with similar effects in rural and urban
settings. We attributed the lower odds of having a checkup in rural
regions to the lower density of oral health care providers in these
areas. Integration of rural oral health care into primary care may help
mitigate the challenges due to a shortage of oral health care providers
in rural areas.},
