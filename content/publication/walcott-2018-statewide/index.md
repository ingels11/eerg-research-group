abstract: "Sleep-related infant deaths are a leading cause of infant mortality in Georgia, and these deaths are largely associated with unsafe sleep practices among caregivers. In early 2016, the Georgia Department of Public Health launched the Georgia Safe to Sleep Hospital Initiative, providing hospitals with safe infant sleep information and educational materials to be distributed to families and newborns. This study examined the knowledge and behaviors of a sample of Georgia parents after the implementation of the Hospital Initiative and identified the family characteristics and intervention components most closely associated with the knowledge and practice of safe infant sleep. The primary caretakers of all infants born in Georgia from August to October 2016 were invited to complete a web-based survey 1 month after hospital discharge. The final sample size included 420 parents of newborns, and the primary outcomes assessed included two measures of knowledge and four measures of infant sleep behaviors regarding infant sleep position and location. Most respondents demonstrated knowledge of the correct recommended sleep position (90%) and location (85%). Logistic regression revealed that receipt of information in the hospital was significantly correlated with safe sleep behaviors, and infant sleep habits tended to influence safe sleep practices. Additionally, Medicaid parents receiving bassinets from the hospital were 74% less likely to bed share (OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.007). Implementation of a statewide hospital initiative was associated with high levels of parental knowledge and behavior and may have been successful in reducing the practice of bed sharing among Medicaid parents."
