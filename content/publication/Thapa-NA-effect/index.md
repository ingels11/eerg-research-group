abstract: "**OBJECTIVES:** The goal of the Strong4Life School Nutrition Program is to promote healthy eating in school cafeterias in Georgia by training school nutrition managers and staff members to implement changes in the cafeteria to nudge children to make healthier choices. The objective of our study was to evaluate program effect on (1) school nutrition manager and staff member knowledge of evidence-based strategies and their self-efficacy to make positive changes, (2) the school cafeteria environment, and (3) National School Lunch Program participation. 

**METHODS:** We assessed changes in participant knowledge, beliefs, and self-efficacy by administering a survey before and after training (February-July 2015); a follow-up survey (3 school months posttraining) assessed changes in the cafeteria. A total of 842 school nutrition managers and staff members were trained and completed pre- and posttraining surveys; 325 managers completed the follow-up survey. We used cafeteria records from a subsample of the first schools trained (40 intervention and 40 control) to assess National School Lunch Program participation. 

**RESULTS:** From pretraining to posttraining, we found a significant increase in manager and staff member (n = 842) knowledge of strategies for enhancing taste perception through the use of creative menu item names (from 78% to 95%, P < .001) and understanding that food placement in the lunch line influences food selection (from 78% to 95%, P < .001), and in their self-perceived ability to influence the cafeteria environment (from 91% to 96%, P < .001). From pretraining to 3-month follow-up, managers (n = 325) reported increased use of evidence-based serving strategies: visibility (from 84% to 96% for placing healthy options in >2 locations, P < .001), convenience (from 63% to 84% for placing plain milk in front of other beverages, P < .001), sell (from 25% to 38% for branding healthy items with stickers, P < .001), price (from 17% to 27% for using bundle pricing to encourage sales, P < .001), and taste (from 77% to 85% for signage demonstrating the benefits of healthy eating, P = .01). National School Lunch Program participation did not change significantly. 

**CONCLUSIONS:** Training cafeteria managers and staff members in Smarter Lunchrooms Movement techniques may be an effective way to make changes in the school cafeteria environment to encourage healthier choices among students. Additional studies allowing time for more complex changes to be implemented are needed to assess the full effect of the program."
